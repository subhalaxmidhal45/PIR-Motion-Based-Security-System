# PIR Motion-Based Security System Using Arduino

## Description
This project uses a PIR motion sensor with Arduino to detect human motion
and activate LEDs as a security alert.

## Components Used
- Arduino UNO
- PIR Motion Sensor
- LEDs
- Resistors
- Breadboard
- Connecting wires

## Working
- PIR sensor is connected to digital pin 5.
- Arduino reads the PIR output.
- When motion is detected, alert LEDs turn ON.
- When no motion is detected, LEDs turn OFF.

## Applications
- Home security
- Intruder alert systems
